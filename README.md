Step-by-Step Setup
Clone the Repository: Open your terminal or command prompt and run:


Copy code
git clone https://github.com/devesh2617/ofbusiness-contact-manager.git
This will download the project files to a folder named ofbusiness-contact-manager.

Navigate to the Project Directory: Change into the cloned directory:


Copy code
cd contact-manager
Install Dependencies: Run the following command to install all required packages (as defined in package.json):


Copy code
npm install
This may take a few minutes. If you encounter any errors, ensure your Node.js version is compatible or check for any specific instructions in the repository's README file.

Run the Development Server: Start the app in development mode:


Copy code
npm run dev
This will typically launch the app on a local server (e.g., http://localhost:5173 or another port specified in the console output).
Open your web browser and navigate to the provided URL to view the app.
The server will auto-reload on code changes, making it ideal for development.
